								<p><b>Table 1</b> four intepretation levels adopted </p>

						</div>
						<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">

							<p>As the iconological approach to visual representations is not unique and a wide importance is given to the subjective intuition of the researcher, we compared interpretation methods formalized by scholars (Panofsky, Wittkower, Van Straten, Gombrich). They consist of the subdivision of the interpretation process in three or four levels of meaning: a pure description of visual elements involved (level 1), the identification of subjects (level 2) and of symbolical (level 3 according to Van Straten and Wittkower), cultural and societal meanings (level 3 for Panofsky, level 4 for Van Straten), or expressions of the artist’s personality (level 4 according to Wittkower).</p>
							
						</div>
					</div>
					<div> 
						<p>We adopted a subdivision in four levels of meaning, distinguishing a symbolic meaning (level 3), voluntarily given by the artist, from an involuntary deeper societal one (l. 4), a symptom of the current culture to which the artwork belongs. Thus, this frame is close to Van Straten’s interpretation, with slight differences: whereas Van Straten focuses on literacy needed to individuate aspects belonging to each level, we focus on the nature of each aspect considered independently from the sources needed to identify it. For example, if societal studies are needed to interpret the subject of an artwork, this will be located at level 2 despite the interpretation process being closer to a fourth level interpretation.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h3>The study</h3>
						<p>The study consists of the analysis of 11 case studies selected from literature based on 4 typological subdivisions, namely: artwork interpretation levels; diachronic changes in subject representation; connection with literary sources; different subjects represented by the same shapes and motifs. </p>
						<p>The division is made on the basis of the analysis of approximately 50 iconological studies performed by Warburg and the major representatives of iconological studies, such as Panofsky, Gombrich, Wittkower. Among the literature, we noticed some recurring structures of the analysis itself. The aim of identifying typologies is to clearly underline which types of elements and relations are usually involved in an iconological interpretation of a subject. Every typology is an abstraction of reality and, in practical terms, more than one typology can be identified. </p>
						<br>

						<p>From the description of the cases emerged that the major part of components embedded in a visual representation can be approximately described by means of vocabularies and thesauri; yet, they don’t discern between pre-iconographical description objects, proper subjects and concepts. The VIR ontology partially covers this need allowing to relate to a vir:IC1_Iconographical_Atom (l. 1) the recognized representation (l. 2) and its major components. However, it’s not possible to link a concept (l. 3) to the whole representation, r to express a 4th level meaning. This issue has been solved in this study by the ideation/supposition of a class called “iconological recognition” that can associate a representation to a third level concept or the physical object to a fourth level concept. </p>
						<p>In addition, for every expression of 4th level concept a formal representation of the concept of “cultural phenomenon” is needed, but there’s not a class that can appropriately describe it in VIR nor in CIDOC-CRM. In this study it’s indicated by means of a general crm:1_entity, indicating the formalisation of an appropriate class for future studies.</p>

						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>Viewers can interpret differently an artwork according to their degree of knowledge of the subject depicted and of the artwork’s cultural context in which that work was produced (i. e. pre-iconographical description, iconographical description, iconographical interpretation, iconological interpretation).</p>
						<p>In this section relations between items located at different levels inside the artwork are analyzed. Precisely, the general interpretation of a representation based on the study of its symbols and single details are considered.</p>

						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>the majority of artworks’ subjects can be identified or deepened through the author’s visual or literary sources that he may have known and used. In this way, subjects represented by means of an unusual iconography can be identified, or, if the representation is not in accordance with its source, it’s possible to understand a new significance voluntarily given to the artwork.</p>
						<p>Different interpretations of this case are considered: firstly, a case in which the subject recognition depends on a specific unknown source; secondly, a manuscript’s miniatures, thus a typology explicitly dependant from the text it should describe, considering examples in which miniatures contradict the text; finally, one case in which the literary subject and its meaning are both accurately recalled.

							<h2>4. Different subjects represented by the same shapes and motifs</h2>
							
						</header>
						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>there are existing examples of artworks that, although different for the historical period, the context of production and subject, present similar shapes and gestures(Panofsky, 1962; Warburg, 1999); it’s sometimes possible to reconstruct the evolution of these traits, identifying the prototype/model. As a consequence, there’s the need of a tool able to detect common features of the visual aspect of artworks that may have different subjects and authors, belonging to different historical contexts. The verbal description made with ontologies and controlled vocabularies may not be able to exhaustively express such visual identity.</p>
						<p>In this study, we focused on the chance to express possible third level meanings and to assign different artworks to a unique interpretation supported in one specific study.

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>In Vermeer’s Woman Holding a Balance (see Fig. 1) the standing woman depicted has been interpreted as a Divine Justice personification (l. 2) by Van Straten; this recognition, as the general moral meaning of the scene, is based on the interpretation of symbols depicted. The woman is weighting with an empty balance, an act that can be seen as a parallel to the Last Judgement depicted in the painting in the background, an event in which Christ weights and judges souls at the end of times according to the moral conduct of each one. The symbolic meaning of other objects in the room support this interpretation: the mirror hung on the wall exactly at the height of the woman’s face is a symbol of introspection, and the jewellery box on the table represents the vanitas of earthly goods. Thus, a relation between two actions, one real and the other metaphorical (act of weighting), suggests that the symbolical meaning proper of the latter is the reading key of the former: the woman is morally weighting her conduct as an invitation to the observer to do the same (l. 3). The Divine Justice personification depends on this interpretation as well, but, since it’s a subject (l. 2) remanding to a concept (l. 3), it’s located in the second interpretation level, next to the genre subject firstly individuated.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, this artwork interpretation can then lead to other considerations, such as the cultural value or the purpose of use that a similar artwork could have had in the Dutch context of the seventeenth century (l. 4). Indeed, similarities with Vermeer’s Allegory of Faith, which reminds of the contemporary prohibition of public profession of catholic faith (Liedtke, 2010), can lead to the conclusion that the artwork in object is another document of this historical phenomenon.

									<h6> Formal representation of <i>Woman Holding a Balance</i> </h6>
									<p> VIR ontology can model up to 3rd level meanings; it's necessary to shape the cultural phenomenon and action parallelism </p>
							</div>
							<p>The chart shows how it’s possible to represent the <b>artwork content by means of CIDOC-CRM and VIR ontologies</b>. Thus, the physical artwork (crm:E22_Man-Made_Object, in the bottom of the picture) is composed of iconographical atoms. One of them identifies all the pictorial surface, whereas the other two individuates two specific portions of it by the relation crm:P46_is_composed_of, as the domain of the relation is crm:E18_Physical_Thing, superclass of vir:IC1_Iconographical_Atom. This subdivision allows to specify at the same time the entire representation and its attributes (on the left) and all the relevant representations that should be described more in detail. In order to clarify this dependence, the relation vir:K20_is_composed_of relates the whole representation to istances representing specific parts contained in it. </p>
							<p>As specified before, Vermeer’s painting presents two subjects at the same level. This is described by means of relating to the same vir:IC1_Iconographical_Atom labelled “woman” two individuals of vir:IC9_representation, one representing the woman holding a balance, the other representing the personification of Divine Justice; Van Straten will be specified as the author of the last identification. The two representations are linked by the relation vir:K23_connote. The same problem, for which we adopted the same solution, is present in Lotto's <a href="#second_artwork"><i>Venus and Cupid</i></a>, since the putto impersonating Cupid, identified by means of his arch and quiver, is at the same time acting as a puer mingens, a putto who pees in the sign of auspicious wish of fertility. 
							</p>
							<p>The <b>actions parallelism </b>considered above is expressed by means of a relation between two individuals of crm:E5_Event, linked to the representation to which they belong by crm:P138_represents. It’s necessary to model a new relation, since the existing crm:P67_refers_to has as domain crm:E89_Propositional_object.</p>
 							<p>This solution is further applied in other following case studies in order to express other actions: the act of peeing made by the iconography of the puer mingens in Lotto’s <a href="#second_artwork"><i>Venus and Cupid</i></a> and in the <a href="#sixth_artwork"><i>Annunciation</i></a> in Wurzburg, in which God blows in a tube inserted in Mary’s ear to fulfil the Immaculate Conception through the holy words. Each of these actions is a symbol of another event; this relation is expressed by a icon:refersTo hypothetical property linking the depicted event to the symbolic one.  
							</p>

										<li><a href="#guide" class="button special">Legend</a></li>

								</div>
							</div>

							<p>Finally, the iconological interpretation had been expressed by linking the two paintings taken into account (Vermeer’s woman holding a balance and Allegory of Faith) to the cultural phenomenon recognized by means of two instances of “iconological recognition”, an hypothetical model for a class that could represent iconological and iconographical interpretations not described by current ontologies. Since it’s on the basis of the recognition of the phenomenon in Allegory of Faith that its presence in the other painting it’s supposed, it’s considered worthwhile to express this dependence by means of the relation cito:obtainsBackgroundFrom. </p>
							<p>This representation can be further used for deeper meaning inferences: both the representations present the same attribute (vir:IC10_Attribute “home interior”)  and the same level 3 concept (crm:E28_conceptual_object “catholic theme depicted in home interior”) cited as evidence of the two iconological recognition. Thus, it’s possible to infer that if a painting belonging to the Dutch Golden Age has both these instances annotated, the painting may be related to the cultural phenomenon individuated. </p>

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>Similar solutions had been adopted to represent Lotto’s <i>Venus and Cupid </i>(see Fig. 2). The epithalamic message (l. 3) of this artwork had been interpreted on the basis of the symbols depicted, and related to the social tradition of  paintings donated as a wedding wish for wedding occasions (l. 4). 
								 <p>The numerous symbols present in the scene can have a meaning belonging to themes related to love and marriage: fertility (<i>puer mingens</i>, cone shell), typical dressing of a Venetian bride (tiara, earrings, veil) bridal chamber (myrtle crown, red cloth, incense burner), seduction (Venus’ belt), love and fidelity (knotted ribbon bracelets, rose, ivy), jealousy (snake) and the stick with which Venus punished Cupid. These meanings can be recognized thanks to coeval visual and literary sources, including the classical ones that could be known at the time (Christiansen 1986, 2018). </p> 
								 <p>Furthermore, the theme of Cupid inviting Venus to hurry to preside over the wedding was widespread in classical epithalamic compositions and the remediation from literal to figurative medium happened by the habit of representing Venus and Paris on the inside of the lid of the wedding chests. <p> On the basis of the interpretation of symbols and wedding clothes, added to Venus's acception as the deity of conjugal love, the painting has been recognized as clearly linked to the tradition of epithalamic paintings donated in wedding occasions. In addition, Christiansen (1986) recognizes that Venus could be the portrait of the bride to whom the painting was destinated for her marriage.

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>The last case belonging to this section expresses a more complex scenario: it’s a cycle composed by 3 complete scenes and, in addition, numerous aspects of the cultural and historical context are involved; thirdly, it’s inserted in the evolution of the specific iconography of Magi, linked with politics (Cardini et. al, 2001). </p>
								<p>The Benozzo Gozzoli Procession of the Magi (1459-1462) is depicted in the family chapel, located in the core of Palazzo Medici in Florence, the building at the time still not finished destined to be the symbol of the increasing family’s importance.
								</p> 
								<p>The iconographical choice for this location is significant since the Magi is an iconography closely linked to politics and the concept of sacralization of power: they were considered heirs of the conception of the earthly emperor legitimized by a divine power that already characterized the Augusti of the Roman Empire from Constantine onwards (Cardini et. al, 2001). In the contemporary Florentine context, then, the Magi’s festivity was narrowly linked to the Medici family, allowing the hypothesis that the scene depicted can allude to the procession of Magi performed during this occasion. In fact, portraits of members of the family are depicted in the procession.</p>
								<p>The Cardini’s (2001) reading of the fresco as the representation of political aspirations of the family is based on the recognition of John VIII Palaiologos, the Byzantine Emperor, painted as the adult Mago, while, as Marco Bussagli affirms, the old Mago is the portrait of Sigismund of Luxemburg, Holy Roman Emperor (1433-1437). Thus, the young descendant of the family, depicted as the young Mago, is symbolically represented as the future ruler of the known world as the heir of the West and East rulers of the roman empire.</p>

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>the first case study taken into account in this section affords the phenomenon described by Panofsky, who recognises that during Middle Ages can be found representations in which classical themes are “expressed by nonclassical figures in a nonclassical setting” (Panofsky, p. 43); one reason is in the different tradition - textual for the contents, visual for motifs - with which classical themes were transmitted from late antiquity onward. The second tradition will be examined in section 4. Thus, the cited textual copy tradition, being not influenced by originary visual motifs, often includes manuscripts in which the classical content is illuminated through the lenses of fully medieval representational conventions and imaginary. Besides that, the scholar claims as a further cause of this change the reached maturity of a new artistic style. </p>
								<p>These features can be clearly identified in the XV miniature taken into account (Fig. 4): the Rape of Proserpina event is depicted as a courteous scene. Hence, Proserpina becomes a lady picking flowers in a meadow who tends her hand towards a knight sticking out of a chariot, accompanied by a figure with three canine heads wearing medieval armour. The characters can be identified only by their written names and the theme is not understandable except by the text written in the illuminated manuscript, as in the scene no trait suggests a kidnapping. 
								</p> 
								<p>Whereas in this cases level 3 meanings are not considered, we focus on how to model representation features and the link with the illuminated text, finally relating the artworks involved to the cultural phenomenon (l. 4) individuated by Panofsky. </p>

									<h6>Representation of the miniature and statue of <i>The rape of Proserpina</i></h6>
									<p> Current ontologies and controlled vucabularies can shape the attributes and basic motifs changes, but a way to express the fact that these differences are meaningful doesn't currently exist</p>
							</div>
							
							<p>In order to relate attributes to the figure they properly identify, every character is expressed by an instance of vir:IC9_representation to which attributes are linked (charts 8-10). The difference in the representational motifs is highlighted by associating to them the closest term of a controlled vocabulary. In this way, relevant aspects can be annotated, such as that Pluto is characterized by armour and a chariot in Fig. 4 and by the seminude figure in Fig. 5, in addition to the difference of attributes related to his figure. This is indeed the only way found in which the stylistic difference - fundamental for the iconological interpretation phase - can be registered. Hence, further studies can be done in order to figure out how to model a difference between two or more objects when this difference is meaningful.   
							</p>
							<p>Furthermore, a relation able to specify that an existing difference between two artworks can support the iconological recognition linking the artworks taken into account to the cultural phenomenon discovered doesn’t currently exist(l. 4).
							</p>
							<p>Finally, since the tradition taken into account concerns texts, one important aspect is that, usually, representations depicting it are miniatures, thus artworks narrowly related to the text they represent. This dependence can be expressed by means of an instance of crm:P128_carries relating the object representing the manuscript to crm:E73_information_object, which individuates the specific textual passage illuminated. The same passage is the source of the vir:IC12_visual_recognition. </p>

More considerations about the topic will be treated in example 3 of typology 3. One possible solution adopted in this study consists of using the cito:citesAsEvidence relation citing the classical statue as a source of the iconological recognition, as it witnesses the style and motifs difference.

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>The last case study of this section (Figg. 7, 8), concerning the Mary Immaculate Conception, had been selected as representative of examples in which iconographical variants of the same subject witness different beliefs or societal aspects. Indeed, different theories on how the religious event took place exist since Luke’s Gospel (I:26-38) doesn’t explain it in detail; the most common one given by Church Fathers is that it happened during the Annunciation, because God, speaking through archangel Gabriel, fertilised the Virgin (Hirn, 1957, pp. 296-298).  Artworks depicting this subject reflect the hypothesis about how it happened: whereas the common iconography of the Immaculate Conception is depicted by a beam of light containing the Holy Spirit dove which hits Mary’s head, in some cases, artists try to represent the God word penetrating Mary through her ear. </p>
								<div class="image fit">
									<img src="images/img08.jpg" alt="" />
									<p><b>Fig. 8 </b>c. XV sculptor, <i>Annunciation</i>, Würzburg, Marienkapelle, gable of the north portal</p>
								</div>
								<p>To model this variant, we compared the Jan Van Eyck painting, showing the classical iconography, to the Marienkapelle representation (Fig. 8). The latter shows God blowing through a tube in the woman's ear, to physically express the theory treated above. In other artworks, different variants of the theme depending on theologians interpretations can be found (i. e. Pacino di Bonaguida, Lignum vitae, 1310-1315, Florence, Gallerie dell'Accademia).  
								</p> 
								<p>The attention given to the theme, witnessed by textual and figurative examples, indicates how important the subject was for the period taken into account (XII-XV century) and reflects the different beliefs (l. 4) enlightened by the textual and visual solutions conceived to explain the religious mystery and thanks to the identification of theological sources.</p>

							<p>Vocabularies and thesauri taken into account can describe subjects considered but not enough in detail to distinguish significant variants of the iconography.    
							</p>
							<p>As the immaculate conception event is represented during the annunciation, these events are individuated by two different vir:IC9_representation linked to the same vir:IC1_Iconographical_Atom in the study of the two artworks considered (charts 11-12). The characters depicted are then described as another instance of representation in order to identify which attributes or meanings correspond to a specific character, and both events’ representation will point at them since they’re simultaneously acting in them. To make variants clearer, each individual has been related to the most specific term of a controlled vocabulary.
							</p>
							<p>One event that cannot be carefully described by current ontologies is the act of symbolically fecundating Mary by means of a tube in which God blows his word. As described in case study 1 of section 1, in this study we solved this issue by representing it with a “refers to” relation linking the event depicted (blowing in the tube) to the symbolical one (fecundation). In this way, iconographical variants can be carefully described.  </p>

Moreover, this identification can support a more general conclusion about the cultural phenomenon witnessed by both of them (different medieval beliefs regarding the Immaculate Conception are depicted by visual arts).  </p>

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>In the first case study of this section - the lunette representing Pan in Correggio’s Camera di San Paolo (Fig. 10) - we consider an artwork whose subject has been identified by means of the individuation of its possible source, probably known by the author. This fact is relevant since it’s an iconography with unusual attributes that wouldn’t have been properly identified without the discovery of the cited source, as for the 1912 Warburg’s study on Schifanoia frescoes the discovery of Abū Maʿshar work’s Latin traduction by Pietro d’Abano had been fundamental (Warburg, 1999). </p>
								<p>On the basis of the analysis of the buyer's - the abbess Gioanna da Piacenza - social context, culture and position, Panofsky interprets the room depicted by Correggio and the adjacent one (1961). Thus, he interprets the decoration as a refined symbology, supposing a general understanding. The scholar focuses specifically on monochrome lunettes painted at the basis of the vault, analysing the subject literary sources and identifying their iconographical evolution.
								</p> 
								<p>The only lunette depicting Pan is included in this study as an example of the approach adopted for the remaining ones. Usually interpreted as a satyr, the human figure with goat legs and horns is portrayed in profile; he’s blowing in a shell, while behind him there’s a tree trunk to which the syrinx is hung. According to Panofsky, it’s represented here Pan deity of terror, since there’s one textual tradition - from Aratus’ Phaenomena (III  century B.C.) to scholars contemporary to Correggio -  reporting that Pan used to provoke terror by blowing in a cone shell (Panofsky, 1961). According to this interpretation, the syrinx hung in the background indicates the abandoned benevolent attitude of Pan (l. 3).</p>
								<p>As mentioned above, the scholar attempts an interpretation of the whole cycle of lunettes. Thus, he links the Pan figure to the remaining of the east wall, representing the personification of Chastity and Integrity. He affirms that the latter figures face the former in a challenge towards the Panic terror (l. 3). Finally, it’s possible to recognize a fourth level meaning, since it’s possible to see that it’s a testimony of the taste for cryptic representations of the cultured elite to which the buyer belonged.</p>

							<p>The recognized iconography linked to the attribute (cone shell) and source that allows interpreting it cannot be properly described by vocabularies, as they consider Pan terrifying people and the cone shell separately. Nevertheless, VIR ontology allows to fully describe this identification by means of vir:ic12_visual:recognition class: it’s possible to specify Panofsky as the author, the source text and the reference to the scholar’s article (chart 14).  
							</p>
							<p>Furthermore, by means of this ontology it’s possible to declare the symbolical meaning of attributes. The subject Pan is then identified by the relation to the precise Iconclass term 92L542 Pan terrifying people, so-called panic fear. In order to express the meaning of the lunette related to the next one (l. 3), we use an iconological recognition instance assigning to the representations taken into account the general meaning. Another one instance of the same class finally relates to the artwork cultural phenomenon recognised in the societal context of the buyer, already related to the buyer by means of CIDOC-CRM classes.

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>Irving Lavin (1993) studied the iconography of the Neptune fountain in Bologna (1563-66) relating it to the urban renewal project designed by the papal vicelegate Pier Donato Cesi (1522-1586), in a period in which the city was governed by the Church. According to the study of documents concerning the urban plan, the aim was to affirm the positivity of the papal domain over the city (l. 3), though remembering that opponents would be punished (Lavin, 1992, p. 28). Neptune was one of the three statues planned during this occasion. </p>
								<p>Its iconography is precisely taken from Raimondi’s print decorating the first book of Virgil’s Aeneid commissioned by pope Julius II (Fig. 12). It depicts the Quos Ego iconography: it’s the scene in which Neptune intervenes to calm the storm caused by Aeolus at the request of Juno, claiming his authority over the marine kingdom through an unfinished threat toward the transgressor (Verg, Aen, I, v. 135). 
								</p> 
								<p>A third level political meaning is already present in Virgil’s text: in this passage, Neptune is depicted as a worthy nobleman who placates a popular tumult with his words, alluding to the Ottavian’s Pax Augusta. In addition to that, Aeneis was considered the symbol of the universal power of the Church, since it’s the roman empire - whose birth is celebrated by the text - that allowed the flourishing of the Christian religion in the known world. Thus, as the iconography had probably been already interpreted by pope Julius II as a symbol of the Christian ruler, it’s clearly been used with this symbolic meaning by Cesi, effective ruler of Bologna. Cesi’s words about the statue confirm this interpretation:  he “compares the action to that of the ruler who would liberate his subjects from all fear of disturbances'' (Lavin, 1993, p. 80). An additional meaning associated with Neptune’s character is that he was considered the personification of reason and intelligence during the Middle Ages. </p>
								<p>Furthermore, the basis of the fountain presents significant symbols (l. 3) of love (putti hugging dolphins), persuasion (dolphins from whose mouth gushes water, mermaids), references to pope Pius IV to whom the fountain is dedicated (metaphor of Pius water reported on the commemorative medal of its realization) and to the Council of Trent (the word “trident” reminds of “tridentinum”). </p>
								<p>Finally, a fourth level meaning could be seen by the interpretation of the iconographical study described, such as the habit of expressing political messages through meaningful symbols.

							<p>Vocabularies allow describing all the l. 1 items (except the trident and the related Council of Trent), the quos Ego iconography (l. 2) and l. 3 symbolic concepts.   
							</p>
							<p>Since the fountain presents the Quos Ego iconography and other symbols, each of them is formally expressed by a vir:IC9_representation related to the corresponding vir:IC1_Iconographical_Atom (chart 15). VIR ontology can also fully describe the author of visual recognition, the concepts that the symbols are representing and related terms of vocabularies. Neptune as personification and the trident as attribute are then specified. 
							</p>
							<p>Furthermore, the Quos Ego representation is related by crm:P107_show_features_of to the Raimondi’s representation. As the context of production is relevant, it has been expressed by CIDOC-CRM classes and relations. Moreover, in order to highlight the fact that the iconography had been referenced to highlight the role of the ruler, this has been annotated by pro:RoleInTime referred respectively to Neptune, pope Julius II and Pier Donato Cesi. </p>

							</div>

							<p>Since the aim is to express the fact that the Virgil’s scene has been referenced to express the same meaning, we figured out a way in which it’s possible to express it. New classes and properties should be outlined; thus, an iconological recognition instance associates to the Quos Ego iconography the concept of the ruler who quells the rioting, citing Aeneis as the source (chart 16). Then, on the basis of that, another iconological recognition associates to Quos Ego another meaning explicitly related to the bolognese context (“affirmation of papal power over the city of Bologna”). Albeit it’s a possible solution, it doesn’t fully describe the attribution of the meaning to the source. Therefore, it’s necessary to do further studies on how to represent a meaning expressed in a textual work that is remediated in visual artwork. Finally, this last instance can support the fourth level meaning interpretation by linking the artwork to the habit described above, though no existing class has been individuated to represent such a cultural phenomenon. </p>

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>The last case study of this section considers those differences between the artwork and its source voluntarily made that can lead to fourth level considerations. </p>
								<p>Wittkower’s study (1987) on Marco Polo’s Milione unique illuminated manuscript (Bibliothèque Nationale de France, ms 2810) examines miniatures in contrast with the text. In fact, Polo’s report of his journey in Eastern lands was more realistic than other ones that were more influenced by the current Marvels of the East beliefs, depicting Asia as a “fabulous land of wonders” (Wittkower, 1987); therefore, he often explicitly contradicts the contemporary legends.
								</p> 
								<p>Nonetheless, illuminations illustrating these passages adhere to the same legends that Polo describes as false. It happens several times: the Unicorn, described by Polo as a rhinoceros, but illuminated as in the common imagery to represent “wild animals” (folio 85r); the Roc, described as similar to griffon for his size but with different features, depicted half-hidden to conceal the differences (folio 88r); a creature described as a crocodile but represented as a winged dragoon (folio 55v; fig. 13); the Salamander, clearly described as a mineral in contrast to common beliefs, but represented as a man among flames even though not burning, a symbol of the right man who’s not burned by lust and sensuality, as common beliefs say ((folio 24r; fig. 14).
								</p>
								<p>Wittkower concludes that this phenomenon expresses that the traditional beliefs concerning the Orient were so entrenched as to contradict the text they are supposed to depict because not following these traditions (l. 4)</p>

							</div>
							<p>By way of example, the analysis that can be conducted on all these examples is applied on two of them, namely the crocodile and the salamander.  
							</p>
							<p>The subjects taken into account can be identified with vocabularies terms but not fully described, nor the fact that the same term “salamander” can correspond to two different subjects (charts 17, 18). Moreover, VIR can properly describe the attribution (vir:IC12_visual_recognition), his author, attributes and conceptual objects (i.e. the concept of “right behaviour” expressed by the right personification in salamander traditional iconography). Although that, as in some case studies above (case 1 and 2 of section 1; case 3 of section 2), actions are not properly described by this ontology; therefore, we expressed the act of the salamander’s not burning among flames as an event, referring to another event (the right man not burned by lust and sensuality). 
							</p>
							<p>Moreover, the miniature is described as part of the manuscript carrying the text of Milione, not cited as the source of Wittkower’s visual recognition.  It’s thus possible to express the fourth level meaning by means of an iconological recognition linking the artwork to the phenomenon described, citing the author but not citing Marco Polo’s text as a source. In fact, indicating it just as carried by the same manuscript carrying the miniature but not as a source of the image interpretations is an implicit way to affirm that the iconography is not following the text; however, the issue remains open. It would be necessary to describe the text content as VIR does for visual representation in order to compare their details. To clearly highlight this slight difference, we described the concept in the cultural phenomenon label, linked to the artworks by means of an hypothetical iconological recognition class. Hence, whereas illustrated in two separate charts for clarity reasons, the two illuminations are linked to the same cultural phenomenon by a unique iconological recognition. It’s further possible to adopt this structure to relate to the fourth level phenomenon all the miniatures considered by the author as proof of it, indicating the study as the source. </p>

								<h4>Artwork description</h4>
								<p>The first case study of this section considers an example belonging to the tradition of classical visual motifs adopted to represent subjects and content more close to the Middle Ages imagery,  identified by Saxl and Panofsky, opposite to the tradition treated in section 2. </p>
								<p>The Benozzo Gozzoli Procession of the Magi (1459-1462) is depicted in the family chapel, located in the core of Palazzo Medici in Florence, the building at the time still not finished destined to be the symbol of the increasing family’s importance.
								</p> 
								<p>This phenomenon (l. 4) belongs to South Europe countries, where classical visual artworks examples were present. Therefore, that’s the case of a late imperial roman age relief representing Hercules and the Erymanthian Boar (Fig. 15) prototype of the medieval Allegory of Salvation. Since they are both placed on the external wall of Basilica di San Marco in Venice, it’s possible to suppose that the medieval artist directly looked at the roman example as a prototype and intentionally used its motifs to express a subject closer to his sensibility. Thus, although the whole visual composition is unvaried, the boar becomes a deer (l.1), a symbol of the soul (l. 3), king Eurystheus a dragoon crushed by Christ, standing for the devil (l. 3), the lion skin, cloth and Hercules carrying the Erymanthian boar to King Eurystheus turns into Christ who defeats the devil and saves the believers’ souls (Panofsky, Saxl, 1933, p. 228) standing for an allegory of salvation. </p>

							</div>
							
							<p>As represented in chart 19, all first level objects, subjects and basic meanings can be identified with vocabularies, except Eurystheus and the concept of salvation. It’s opportune to highlight that the Iconclass vocabulary identifies exactly the scene represented (94L3241 Hercules carries the boar across his shoulders to Eurystheus, who takes refuge in a bronze tub). Furthermore, by means of crm:P53_has_current_location it’s possible to register St. Mark’s Basilica as the place common to the artworks, important for the recognition of relationships among them. As for the previous case studies, VIR can describe the representation, character, attributes and related vocabulary terms. In addition, the relation vir:K4i_has_visual_prototype can link one artwork to its source, further specified by the subproperty vir:K4.1_prototipical mode that allows expressing which type of relation exists (in this case, “formal motifs recovery”). Nevertheless, this relation doesn’t allow to specify the author and the 4th level phenomenon individuated by the scholars. Thus, an iconological recognition to relate the two artwork considered with the cultural phenomenon is needed; in this way, more artworks witnessing this aspect can be related to the same phenomenon.

								<h4>Artworks description</h4>
								<p>The last case study considered is included in a Wittkower’s essay (1938) on the evolution of the relationship between the concepts of Time, Opportunity and Virtue from the classical period to the XVIII century. Among them, the motif of Bernini’s Rape of Proserpina retaken by other artists to depict different subjects is analyzed. This particular case study consists of an iconographical study included in a more general consideration; thus, it doesn’t concern fourth level meanings but the evolution of time and opportunity concepts (l. 3) in different artworks, broadly considered in the essay in different centuries (l. 4). </p>
								<p>Due to the great success of the Bernini sculpture, the motif was well known in all Europe; hence, Poussin and Rubens used it to depict the subject of Time carrying off the Truth. In this first passage, there’s a radical change regarding the action expressed: a rape is substituted with a positive discovery. Thus, the action cannot be characterized by the same identifier. Moreover, another statue using the same motif is known, which depicts the Abduction of Cybele by Saturn, whereas the lion is Cybele’s attribute (Regnaudin, 1678; fig. 17). Because of the influence of Rubens and Poussin models, this statue had been wrongly interpreted as the Time revealing the Truth in 1699. It, in turn, is the model for David Le Marchand’s Time and Opportunity (fig. 18). Therefore, another evolution of the subject has happened, probably because both Truth and Chance present similar (even if opposite) relations with time. Whereas in the former iconography time revealing the truth has a positive connotation, the latter’s representation presents time in a negative relationship with opportunity, since it’s the cause of her loss and, as a consequence, Opportunity is represented while she’s killing herself with a spear. In addition, Wittkower highlights another contrastive relationship between Truth and Opportunity: on the basis of the content of an XVI century philosophical poem (Fregoso’s Dialogo de Fortuna, 1521) truth is interpreted as the only one possible remedy to the uncertainty of the faith, related to the concept of the represented Occasio.

							<p>All the subjects considered can be described with VIR classes (l. 1, l. 2). In particular, the relation vir:K4i_has_visual_prototype links each artwork to its visual model (charts 20, 21).   
							</p>
							<p>The popularity of Rubens’ and Poussin's new interpretation of the iconography led to wrongly interpret Regnaudin’s sculpture. Thus, two vir:IC12_visual_recognition relate the same sculpture to two different representations, one of them having a time-span “1699” and linked to Rubens’ and Poussin’s artworks (chart 20). Moreover, the evolution of this subject to Time and Opportunity is explained by different interpretations of the concepts involved (l. 3; chart 21). To express the difference between them, two concepts describing the positive or negative attitude of Time toward Truth or Occasio are linked to the two representations by a hypothetical “expresses” property, shortcut of the third level interpretation. In addition, an iconological recognition relates to Time and Opportunity’s representation the concept resulting from Fregoso’s text considered, indicated as evidence.

									<h6> Chart 22 </h6>
									<p> #### </p>
							</div>

							<p>Finally, the evolution of the concepts involved is identified by another instance of iconological recognition (l. 3): in this way, more relevant examples considered by Wittkower can be added to the results described. Nevertheless, this solution doesn’t express exactly what’s the aim to depict, since it considers meaning evolutions and not the formal motifs retrieval. Thus, the chart 22 shows how the iconological recognition instance is a modelling that could properly represent this situation, albeit more studies are needed, since a pure formal motifs evolution cannot be identified as a cultural phenomenon or a concept. </p>
